Summary

I am a bioengineer and engineering management graduate student with a strong technical foundation in software development, machine learning, and hardware prototyping. I have significant experience in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript, along with additional exposure to R, React Native, and OpenGL. Across research labs, medtech startups, and academic engineering environments, I have worked on projects that combine quantitative analysis, system design, and practical problem-solving. I enjoy building tools that are both technically rigorous and user-oriented, and I approach every project with clarity, discipline, and a focus on producing meaningful impact.

Experience

My professional background spans biotechnology, medical devices, scientific computing, and clinical research. As a Microscope Programmer in the Parasite Biophysics Lab, I created Python software that interfaced directly with a STED microscope, automating image acquisition, parasite tracking, and large-scale time-lapse dataset management. My work improved workflow efficiency and supported high-throughput analysis.

During my internship at Fogarty Innovation with G-Tech Medical, I contributed to the GutTracker™ GI motility monitoring patch. I performed hydrogel reliability experiments, conducted Fourier-transform signal analysis in Python, and measured battery power demand using C++ and NI DAQ hardware. I also gained experience in medtech innovation strategy, regulatory navigation, and investor readiness.

Prior to this, I interned in a Cardiothoracic Surgery Lab, where I performed PCR-based genotyping for Loeys-Dietz Syndrome and maintained cardiac muscle cell cultures for diagnostic testing. Outside of research, I competed as an NCAA Division I wide receiver at Stanford and Rice, where I developed discipline, resilience, and time-management skills, earning Academic All-Conference honors and serving twice as team captain. My role as Chairman of the Girard Debate Society strengthened my leadership, communication, and critical thinking as I organized debates and managed alumni relations.

Projects

My engineering and software projects span computational modeling, hardware prototyping, and applied biomedical design. I collaborated with physicians to develop a pressure-sensing self-retaining retractor aimed at reducing spinal surgery complications by providing improved intraoperative feedback. I also designed a layered catheter prototype to mitigate biofilm infections, supported by stakeholder interviews, market analysis, requirements engineering, and full documentation.

On the computational side, I built a machine learning model to predict college football play-calling tendencies, combining CFBD API data with Scikit-Learn algorithms and clear visualizations to interpret model predictions. I developed a Python library for neural network simulation, enabling analysis of spatiotemporal signaling efficiency in hardware-inspired architectures. Additionally, I engineered an Arduino-based centrifuge featuring custom circuit design, a PID controller, and an event-driven interface. Across all projects, I focus on building reliable systems, understanding user requirements, and translating ideas into functioning prototypes or analytical tools.

Technical & Soft Skills

I am proficient in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript, with experience in R, React Native, OpenGL, and various scientific computing workflows. My technical capabilities include image processing, data analysis, embedded systems, hardware interfacing, and machine learning. I enjoy working in settings that require integrating software, hardware, and quantitative reasoning.

My soft skills have been shaped by leadership roles, high-level athletics, and collaborative engineering projects. I communicate clearly, work effectively in teams, and approach challenges with discipline and adaptability. Whether managing responsibilities in research labs, medtech startups, or competitive sports, I bring a combination of technical precision and dependable execution.
