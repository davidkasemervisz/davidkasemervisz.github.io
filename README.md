# David Kasemervisz

## Summary

I am a bioengineer and engineering management graduate student with a strong technical foundation in software development, machine learning, and hardware prototyping. I have experience in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript, as well as familiarity with R, React Native, and OpenGL. Through research labs, medtech startups, and academic engineering projects, I have worked on systems that blend analytical thinking, practical engineering, and clean software design. I enjoy building tools that solve meaningful problems and approaching every project with clarity, discipline, and a focus on real impact.

## Experience

My professional experience spans biotechnology, medical devices, scientific programming, and clinical research. As a microscope programmer in the Parasite Biophysics Lab, I developed Python software that interfaced with a STED microscope to automate image acquisition, parasite tracking, and large time-lapse dataset management. This work improved workflow efficiency and supported high-throughput analysis.

At Fogarty Innovation and G-Tech Medical, I contributed to the GutTracker GI motility monitoring patch by conducting hydrogel reliability experiments, performing Fourier-transform analysis, and measuring battery power demand using C++ and NI hardware. I also gained exposure to medtech innovation strategy, regulatory processes, and investor readiness.

In the Cardiothoracic Surgery Lab, I performed PCR-based genotyping for Loeys-Dietz Syndrome and maintained cardiac muscle cell cultures. Outside the lab, I competed as an NCAA Division I wide receiver at Stanford and Rice, where I developed discipline, resilience, and strong time-management skills. Serving as chairman of the Girard Debate Society strengthened my leadership, public speaking, and organizational abilities.

## Projects

My projects include work in computational modeling, medical device design, and hardware engineering. I collaborated with physicians to design a pressure-sensing self-retaining retractor intended to reduce spinal surgery complications through intraoperative feedback. I also developed a layered catheter prototype aimed at reducing biofilm-related infections, supported by market research, stakeholder interviews, and complete technical documentation.

In software and analytics, I created a machine learning model that predicts college football play-calling tendencies using the CFBD API and Scikit-Learn, presenting the results through clear visualizations. I also developed a Python library for simulating neural networks to study spatiotemporal signaling efficiency, and I engineered an Arduino-based centrifuge with custom circuitry, a PID controller, and an event-driven interface. Across these projects, I emphasize reliable engineering, clear documentation, and solutions guided by real user needs.

## Technical and Soft Skills

I am proficient in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript, and I have experience with data analysis, image processing, embedded systems, and machine learning. My engineering work combines software, hardware, and analytical reasoning, and I enjoy approaching problems from both a systems and user-centered perspective.

My soft skills have been shaped by leadership roles, high-level athletics, and interdisciplinary project teams. I communicate clearly, work well under pressure, and bring discipline, consistency, and adaptability to every environment I work in.
